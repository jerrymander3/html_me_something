            <p> Dungeons and Dragons is fun. Much more fun than thinking about the ways that our society is collapsing.
            While avoiding this realization, I like to spend my time coming up with fun adventures and scenarios 
            to put my friends through! The role I usually take is that of the Dm, who is the one who is in control
            of the world, npcs, and setting, much unlike the real world where nothing could be further from the truth.

                <h2>How the game works</h2>
                <p> Dnd is a tabletop role-playing game, and as such requires a relatively unusual set of items to play.
                    The bare minimum to play is a copy of the Player's Handbook (essentially the rulebook), a set of dice,
                    and a character sheet and pencils. Usually when I play games in person (which will not happen again 
                    for the forseeable future do to the ineptitude of world leaders), I also like to have my dm screen to 
                    hide my materials from players, a battle mat and markers for drawing areas, and some speakers for ambient
                    music.
                </p>

                <p> The game is played by me, the Dm (or Dungeon master), setting up an adventure for the players to enjoy and experience,
                    and them doing everything in their power to derail everything I have planned, not unlike how energy
                    companies derail all plans I have for my future by prematurely destroying our planet. The dnd rules 
                    allow for players to create characters of all sorts of different backgrounds, skill sets, and quirks,
                    so that everyone can play whatever they want and then wipe to an easy encounter because none of them
                    wanted to play a healer class. This is one of the main draws of the game, and role-playing for hours on
                    end has become quite appealing for many who, like me, risk complete insanity by attempting to keep up 
                    with the ever more depressing news cycles.

                <h3>In summary, Dnd is a fun game, and easy to lose yourself in, which is a far better alternative
                    to losing yourself into the craziness of our society today.
